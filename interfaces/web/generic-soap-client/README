generic-soap-client
-------------------

This is a library that can execute operations of an arbitrary SOAP web service. 

It takes a URL to a WSDL and generates a data structure corresponding to the definitions. 
All operations and input fields can be accessed and set at runtime. After executing an operation,
the returned values and file attachments can be read.
