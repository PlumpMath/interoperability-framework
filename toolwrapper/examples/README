Tool specification examples.

All example's are pretty straight forward, however there are three special cases:

- exiftool (outputstream)

In the exiftool example the following is defined:
  <output name="outputstream">

Giving the output the name 'outputstream' makes it possible to capture the output 
(from stdout, stderr) of a tool and redirect it to an output file.

- unzip (outputdir)

In the unzip example the following is defined:
  <output name="outputdir">

Giving the output name 'outputdir' assumes the tool does not produce a file as output,
but instead it returns a directory as output of the operation.

- ocropus (inputdir)

In the ocropus example the following is defined:
  <input name="inputdir">

Defining an inputname as 'inputdir' will result in cloning or mirroring the remote directory,
and then feeding it to the current tool as input.
